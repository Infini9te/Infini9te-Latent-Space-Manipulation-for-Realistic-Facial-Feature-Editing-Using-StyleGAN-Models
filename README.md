Overview
This project focuses on enhancing the precision and realism of facial feature editing using StyleGAN by leveraging its latent space representation. The core objective is to develop an efficient system for manipulating facial attributes such as age, gender, expression, and other subtle characteristics while maintaining naturalness and consistency in the generated images.

Through this research, we aim to:

Achieve fine-grained control over individual facial features in StyleGAN’s latent space.
Ensure that edited images retain high fidelity and realism.
Explore the boundaries of semantic manipulation, with a focus on disentangling complex facial attributes.
Key Features
Latent Space Exploration: Allows for deep, controlled exploration of StyleGAN’s latent space to target specific facial features.
Feature Disentanglement: Focuses on disentangling complex, intertwined facial attributes to enable independent control.
High-Resolution Image Editing: Supports high-quality, high-resolution facial edits without compromising image fidelity.
Realism and Coherence: Prioritizes maintaining realism, especially in cases where multiple features are edited simultaneously.
Customizable Controls: Provides intuitive controls for precise, user-defined edits, such as altering age, smile intensity, or adjusting lighting.
